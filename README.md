                                Food Delievery application


This is a complete MERN stack application wher the front end is designed in React and backend is design in NodeJS.
The database used to store data data was MongoDB atlas. First orders are registered in the frontend and after
relevant usre inputs the functions are defined in Node Express framework and is dilivers the data to back end
And data is fetched back using an API call from the Mongo DB atlas.
<br/>
<br/>
The file structure is defined in following way <br/>
  i)Backend -> This holds the entire Nodejs and Expressjs code. This files connects the bacend MongoDB Atlas where the data is hosted <br/>
  
  <br/>
  ii) Public -> The basic boiler plate files generated when a react application is created
  <br/>
  <br/>
  iii) src -> it is divided into <br/>
               a) components --> the components which repeats mostly are filed into this file<br/>
               b) Pages --> these are the pages example Home,login,signup etc. <br/>
                            It also triggers the api fetch to display data from MongoDB Atlas. <br/>
                            It also triggers the routes of NOdeJs to createusers as well as register orders on cart check out. <br/>
